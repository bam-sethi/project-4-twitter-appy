# project-4-twitter-appy

For the Final Project I did with GA my main aim was to challenge myself by working with RealTime data and Data Visualisation. I used the Twitter API to live stream tweets and passed them through a Sentiment Analysis API that I could then manipulate on the client side using AngularJS. I made a live updating chart of positive or negative tweets happening in London at any given time.
